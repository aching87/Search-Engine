S'REVENUE SHARING AND STATE FUNDING IN INDIANA: PROSPECTS IMPROVE FOR PUBLIC\nLIBRARIES.'
p527
aS"IN THE EARLY 70S THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR INDIANA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS\nABYSMALLY DEPRESSING, WITH MOST LIBRARIES HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE\nIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS. HOWEVER, AS THE DECADE\nPROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE\nENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972, WHICH PERMITTED\nGOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIR\nOWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASED\nDRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE\nPUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OF\nSENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208. THE OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE 80S IS TEMPERED\nONLY BY THE CONCERN OF LIBRARIANS ABOUT STATE LEGISLATORS' COMMITMENT TO\nCONTINUE STATE FUNDING OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES."

BTX REGISTERED USERS\nWILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM BY TELEPHONE. A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN AS A\nDISPLAY DEVICE AND AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DIGITAL KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE\nNECESSARY. INFORMATION PROVIDERS WILL NEED A KEYBOARD SIMILAR TO THAT OF A\nTYPEWRITER WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO OBTAIN GRAPHICS. AT PRESENT THE\nSYSTEM IS MAINLY ORIENTED TO USERS WITH DIGITAL KEYBOARDS WHICH MEANS THAT ALL\nINFORMATION HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NUMERICAL IDENTIFICATION.\nFACILITY SELECTION IS MADE THROUGH AN INDEX PROCESS PREPARED BY THE USER. THE\nPROCEDURE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY CREATING A USERS' CATALOGUE SUCH AS PRESTEL\nPROVIDES. IF BTX STORAGE FACILITIES ARE EXPANDED AND THE SPEED OF ACCESS IS\nIMPROVED IT SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONNECTING GENERAL AND\nT ECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

THE RESULTS CAN BE\nUSED DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF THE PERSON\nCARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH. MANY LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN ONLY BE CARRIED\nOUT BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES. M.

THE THEORETICAL RESULTS OF BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE MUST\nPERMEATE THE PROFESSIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE. B. QUENTZER DETECTS A\nMISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN LIBRARIES.

WHILST THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN MEDICAL\nINFORMATION CENTER (SEAMIC) HELD ITS 1ST WORKSHOP IN TOKYO IN 1973, THE\nPROBLEM OF THE VARIETY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE REGION IS A BARRIER TO THE\nESTABLISHMENT OF A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. ONLY BY REMOVING\nTHESE BARRIERS AND ESTABLISHING STRONG REGIONAL COOPERATION, CAN INFORMATION\nBE EXCHANGED FREELY, WHICH WILL BE A SURE STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL\nINFORMATION.'

aS'REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL\nDOCUMENT PROVISION, BOSTON SPA, 22-24 SEPT 80. RECENT US DEVELOPMENTS HAVE\nFAVOURED DECENTRALISED NETWORKS RATHER THAN CENTRALISED RESOURCE LIBRARIES. US\nLIBRARIES LACK CENTRAL PLANNING AND FUNDING, AND PROGRESS DEPENDS ON\nINDIVIDUAL LIBRARY INITIATIVES. IN THE LAST 10 YEARS THIS HAS RESULTED IN\nOCLC, RLG, WLN AND 20 REGIONAL NETWORKS. DESCRIBES THE 3 MAJOR COMPUTER\nCOMPUTER UTILITIES. THESE COMPUTER NETWORKS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTED NOT\nDUPLICATED BY CENTRAL RESOURCE LIBRARIES; WITH THE NATIONAL PERIODICALS CENTER\nEFFECTIVELY SHELVED, THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES COULD ASSUME A MORE\nDYNAMIC ROLE. COMMERCIAL VENDORS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT ARE AN IMPORTANT\nELEMENT IN DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUTSIDE CONVENTIONAL\nLIBRARY SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT CREAM OFF THE PROFITABLE END OF THE DOCUMENT SUPPLY\nMARKET .'

MOST LARGER LIBRARY\nSYSTEMS HAVE NOW AUTOMATED THEIR TECHNICAL PROCESSES, BUT AUTOMATION OF THE\nMORE COMPLICATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, SUCH AS LITERATURE SEARCHING WHICH\nNECESSITATE UNIFORM AND WELL DEVELOPED CATALOGUING, IS NOT WIDESPREAD. THE\nPROCESS OF AUTOMATION STARTED IN THE 60S SPURRED LARGELY BY THE GENERAL US\nOPENNESS TOWARDS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PRESSURE FROM COMMERCIAL\nFIRMS. THE LACK OF INTERLIBRARY COOPERATION AND OF STANDARDISATION OF WORK\nROUTINES IN US PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS ENCOURAGED THE ADOPTION OF AUTOMATION\nSYSTEMS TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES. THE GENERAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION\nHAS NOT BEEN MUCH STUDIED, BUT THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\nHAD LED TO CENTRALISATION, LESS INDEPENDENCE FOR BRANCHES, BETTER\nINTERLENDING, AND HAD FREED RESOURCES FOR OTHER SERVICES. ALTHOUGH FEWER STAFF\nTENDED TO BE EMPLOYED, NONE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY MADE REDUNDANT. NO COST-BENEFIT\nANALYSES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE REACTIONS OF USERS, BOTH STAFF\nAND READERS, WERE LARGELY FAVOURABLE, EXCEPT PERHAPS IN BRANCH PUBLIC\nLIBRARIES.'

p10506
aS"APER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,\nUNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND\nMATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TERM\n'INTERNATIONALISM' AS IT IS USED BY THOSE IN THE FIELD OF CHILDREN'S\nLITERATURE IN THE USA. IT IS MOST COMMONLY APPLIED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES WHICH\nCENTRE ON SOME PHASE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. ITS USE\nAPPEARS WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN ARTICLES ON CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AND\nSEMINAR PROGRAMMES. EXAMINATION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE TEXTBOOKS, THEMES FOR\nDOCTORAL THESES PRESENTED 1930-79, AND THE STATUS OF LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS IN\nGRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF EDUCATION INDICATE THAT THE\nINTERNATIONALISM OF THE FIELD IS INCLINED TO BE SUPERFICIAL."

ONE APPROACH WOULD BE TO CONSIDER THEORY AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF\nUNIVERSAL LAWS, AND TO FRAME HYPOTHESES IN UNIVERSAL FORM AND TEST THEM\nAGAINST THE EVIDENCE. ADDRESSES THE LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN US ARCHIVAL THEORY\nAGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR THE PROFESSION IF'\n(1) THE PROFESSION ITSELF REALISES THAT IT IS BOTH A SCIENCE AND A CRAFT; AND\n(2) CERTAIN ARCHIVISTS MAKE THE MOVE FROM THE WORKPLACE TO THE ACADEMY AS A\nPERMANENT CAREER COMMITMENT. THERE THEY MUST REALIGN THEMSELVES WITH ACADEMIC\nHISTORIANS AND OTHERS TO PRODUCE A BODY OF BASIC PRINCIPLES, A SYSTEM OF\nIMMUTABLE LAWS-A LITANY OF THEORY AND DOGMA."

SUCH QUESTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED\nFOR COMMON DENOMINATORS BUT RECENT WORK BY ANDREWS AND HIS COLLABORATORS\n(1979) INDICATES THIS APPROACH TO BE INADEQUATE. USES SIMON'S CONCEPT OF\nLIMITED RATIONALITY AS A GENERAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONAL\nOPERATION, WHICH IS APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING\nRESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE MODEL DOES HELP IN EXPLANATION OF OBSERVATIONS\nFREQUENTLY MADE ABOUT RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS' PREFERENCE FOR INFORMAL\nINFORMATION SOURCES AND PERSONAL CONTACTS, AND THE FORMATION OF INFORMAL\nGROUPS AND NETWORKS. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS WOULD APPEAR TO\nFUNCTION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LIMITED RATIONALITY. THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BE\nUSED TO PREDICT POTE NTIAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS THE\nCONCEPTION AND USE OF THESAURI AND DATA BANKS.

aS'REPORT OF A BRAZILIAN STUDY BASED ON POSTGRADUATE COURSE WORK IN INFORMATION\nSCIENCE, DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE CONSISTENCY OF PERFORMANCE BY A GROUP OF\nINDEXERS IN SELECTING TERMS TO REPRESENT DOCUMENT CONTENT. A PRELIMINARY\nDISCUSSION EXAMINES PREVIOUS STUDIES OF CONSISTENCY AND FORMULAS DEVELOPED TO\nTEST AND MEASURE BOTH INTER AND INTRACONSISTENCY. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE\nMETHODOLOGY USED HERE IN A RESTRICTED STUDY INVOLVING 10 INDEXERS AND 1\nARTICLE, AND RESULTS PRESENTED IN FULL, SHOWING THE NUMBER OF TERMS ASSIGNED\nIN RELATION TO LENGTH OF TIME SPENT; CONSISTENCY BETWEEN TERMS; AND FREQUENCY\nOF USE OF TERMS. THE CONCLUSIONS INDICATE THE NEED FOR VOCABULARY RESTRICTION\nOR PRESCRIPTION OF TERMS TO CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM OF INDEXER SUBJECTIVITY.'

FOR BOTH YEARS\nSURVEYED, ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 7 JOURNALS READ ON A\nREGULAR BASIS. A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF THE 1978 DATA INDICATED THAT 7 OF THE\nTITLES CITED AS BEING READ ACCOUNTED FOR 80% OF THE JOURNAL READING.

aS'FROM ALMOST ITS INCEPTION IN 1937, ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING HAS BEEN\nPRIMARILY A POST-EMPLOYMENT EFFORT. THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OF\nTHE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,\nTHE 2 MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS ARE\nDRAWN. BETWEEN 1937-40 AND 1967-70, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAME\nPERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCE\nTHE EARLY 1970S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.\nINDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSES\nSINCE THE EARLY 1960S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICAN\nLITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HAS\nCONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OF\nARCHIVAL/MANUSCRIPT SOURCES. AN ATTEMPT IN 1967-70 TO DEVELOP AN ARCHIVAL\nMANUAL WITHI N A.L.A. DIED ABORNING AND THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS AND\nSOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS HAVE JUST BEGUN TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEM\nINDEPENDENTLY.

BOOKS INCLUDE FICTION\nAND NON-FICTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND LITERATURE IS ALSO PROVIDED ON\nTAPES (67,000), CASSETTES (25,000) AND RECORDS. SOUND RECORDINGS ARE\nPARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR THE ELDERLY, WHO FIND IT HARD TO LEARN BRAILLE. MOST\nCONTACTS WITH READERS ARE MADE BY POST OR TELEPHONE, BUT THERE IS A PUBLIC\nREADING ROOM WITH CATALOGUES IN NORMAL PRINT AND BRAILLE. THE LIBRARY HAS\nSTAFF AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BRAILLE BOOKS, TALKING BOOKS AND THE\nREPRODUCTION OF TAPES AND CASSETTES. A LIST OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF LARGE\nPRINT BOOKS IS INCLUDED.'

aS'A 6-MONTH EXPERIMENTAL SDI SERVICE WAS UNDERTAKEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NATAL\nLIBRARY, PIETERMARITZBURG SOUTH AFRICA, AS PART OF A PLAN TO MAKE SUBJECT\nLIBRARIANS MORE SERVICE ORIENTATED, AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH TIME\nFOR ACADEMICS WAS AT A PREMIUM. A METHODOLOGY WAS DEVISED AND 21 LECTURERS\nFROM ACROSS THE ACADEMIC SPECTRUM SUBMITTED 27 PROFILES. REFERENCES WERE\nSUPPLIED FROM JOURNALS AND MONOGRAPHS AND FROM ABSTRACTING TOOLS WHERE THE\nLIBRARY HAD POOR LITERATURE COVERAGE. AT THE END OF THE 6 MONTHS, FEEDBACK\nREVEALED THAT 93% OF THE REFERENCES ASSESSED (82%) WERE RELEVANT OR APPARENTLY\nRELEVANT, SHOWING THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC RATHER THAN TERMINOLOGICAL SKILLS WERE\nTHE SALIENT FACTOR. ACADEMIC RESPONSE WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF A\nCONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE, WHILE A FEW RESPONDENTS WANTED MINOR\nIMPROVEMENTS. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE INCREASED JOB\nSATISFACTION AND ALLOWED THEM TO LOOK MORE CRITICALLY AT LIBRARY STOCK. IN\nTERMS OF  TIME AND FINANCIAL COST THE SDI SERVICE WAS EASILY ABSORBED INTO THE\nEXISTING WORK STRUCTURE OF THE LIBRARY. IT WAS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY\nRELEVANT TO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, AND IT RELIED UPON A WELL-DEVELOPED\nSUBJECT LIBRARIAN STRUCTURE.

SECONDLY, REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS\nARE TO BE FOUND MAINLY AT THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY WHILE\nTHIRDLY TECHNICAL COLLEGES AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS OF HIGHER TECHNICAL\nEDUCATION CONCENTRATE ON ALL ASPECTS OF ELECTRICAL POWER, INSTALLATIONS,\nINSTRUMENTS, AND SO ON.

CURRENT\nACADEMIC INTEREST IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE GROWING\nNUMBER OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES FOR ADVANCED DEGREES. THIS TENDENCY IS ALSO\nDISCERNABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA.

aS'IN RECENT YEARS TRAINING FOR THE HIGHER STAFF GRADES HAS UNDERGONE A\nFUNDAMENTAL REFORM. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES WORKING IN ACADEMIC\nLIBRARIES HAS NOW INCREASED. FORMERLY, ALTHOUGH ALL STAFF IN ACADEMIC\nLIBRARIES POSSESSED UNIVERSITY DEGREES, FEW OF THEM POSSESSED QUALIFICATIONS\nIN LIBRARIANSHIP. IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BY CONTRAST, MOST SENIOR STAFF HAVE\nLIBRARIANSHIP QUALIFICATIONS. THE NEW SITUATION HAS BEEN CAUSED BY LEGAL\nCHANGES, THE FINAL RESULTS OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY.

A SINGLE CENTRE IN EACH REGION IS\nRECOMMENDED. A SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT 40% OF ALL REQUESTS\nAT THIS LEVEL CAME FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 40% FROM SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND 20%\nFROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. MOST REQUESTS ARE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (60%), FOR\nENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL (55% OF ALL REQUESTS; 70% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS),\nAND FOR MORE RECENT MATERIAL (65% PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS).

p17583
aS'CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THAN\nDECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SO\nPARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TO\nCENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF\nJOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7,000-8,000 TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80% OF\nDEMAND AND 2,000 TITLES 50% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS IN\nIDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWN\nTO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING\nDIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUS\nFACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSE\nVARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES\n(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTS\nBASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT\nCOUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACT\nSUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IF\nA COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HAS\nADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TO\nACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALS\nIN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,\nBUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCH\nCOLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED.'
